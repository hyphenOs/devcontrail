# devcontrail
Inspired by devstack - A devstack like tool to deploy OpenContrail


## Why?

After taking a look at the OpenContrail code that is mainly distributed as [opencontrail-controller](https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-controller) and [opencontrail-vrouter](https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-controller), it is observed that, it's not trivial to deploy OpenContrail. While I believe it's a great Virtual Networking toolkit it does not support 'Works on My Laptop' feature trivially. This to me is a serious limitation to try out, experiment with OpenContrail.

Goal of this project is to make it easy. This is inspired `./stack.sh` from OpenStack DevStack.
